This Website is made on the behalf of "Hackney Coffee", a community made London based cafe. Users will find all the concise information they need in a simple yet UX orientated design. This project is intended for educational purposes only, and not intended for business/professional use. The project is built with HTML and CSS ONLY and incorporates bootstrap framework to keep the website clear and understable for first-time readers.

# UX Design/Development
## Website Owner Goals
The purpose of this website is to present the cafe's information to the public (new/returning customers). The website owner can present the accessibiliity information (cafe name, location, open hours, contact information for business and enquiries) as well as the cafe's ethos, goals towards the public, history/past achievements and what customers can expect to find within the cafe itself. This information produces the end result of allowing new and returning customers to use said information to have any questions answered as well as interest customers into visiting the store itself.
## New User Goals
- User will be able to find all of the cafe's accessibiliity information resulting in them knowing where they are located as well as open hours.
- User can find any information about the cafe ethos, past achievements and history.
- User can make enquiries about specific questions or comments through the website, or business enquiries.
## Returning User Goals
- User will be able to revisit or remind themselves of all the cafe's accessibiliity information.
- User can revisit or remind themselves any information about the cafe ethos, past achievements or history.
- User can make enquiries about specific questions or comments through the website, or business enquiries.

## Target Audience Wants and Needs

### As a business owner:
- I would like to present myself and my business appropriately showing clearly what my business has to offer for potential customers.
- I need to make sure that potential and returning customers are aware of the store's exact location and open times simply and clearly, so that they are able to locate the store properly and without any issues.
- I want potential customers to be interested by the website/the aesthetic of the website as well as understand clearly what it is intended for at first glance.
- I want potential customers to be able to easily learn to navigate the website with ease.
- I need to create and maintain a good relationship with potential, new and returning customers to create a positive result from a business and reputation standpoint.

### As a new/potential customer:
- I wish to find all the basic information about the business including their ethos, history/past achievements and qualifications.
- I wish to find out what menu items this cafe specialises in, and what other items they serve.
- I want to feel like the cafe advertised in this website is a place that I feel as if I can fit in and share common interests and makes me want to visit.
- I want to find the contact information, location and open hours to this business with relative ease so I can visit, make enquiries and find when is best to visit.

### As a returning customer:
- I wish to be able to revisit all the information in case I need to remind myself of it.
- I wish to use this website as a way of showing others e.g. friends, family about this cafe.

## Website Structure

The website was create with simplicity and ease of access in mind, so that would result in a hassle free positive user experience. This result should not differ between devices as the page is made to be responsive to all common viewports to generate the same positive emotional response. All sections of each page are designed to allow for maximal user satisfaction. Examples of this include the theme or style created being targetted towards coffee, which is a common interest for the target audience, as well as the styling used for hover sections and links leading to the aforementioned positive user response.

## Wireframes

Simple and minimal mockups were created at the start with Balsamiq Wireframes, which I would then experiment with and playtest later in gitpod until I would find positioning and styling that I was happy with.

## Style testing

### Colours
As mentioned above I tested for the best colour combination to allow for readability.
These are the main colours I used:
- Main Background/inverted headers/text for contrast: #f5deb3 (Wheat)
- Main content text: #845c47 (Hazel/Coffee Brown)
- Headers: #644444 (Maroon/Dark Chocolate Brown)

### Fonts
The main font I used was Roboto, and Bebas Neue for the headers. I also used East Sea Dokdo for the menu lists, to give them more of a chalk on blackboard asethetic. I used Sans Serif as a backup font.

### Images
