This project is intended for educational purposes only, and not intended for business/professional use. The project is built with HTML and CSS ONLY and incorporates bootstrap framework to keep the website clear and understable for first-time readers.

# UX Design
## Website Owner Goals
The purpose of this website is to present the cafe's information to the public (new/returning customers). The website owner can present the accessibiliity information (cafe name, location, open hours, contact information for business and enquiries) as well as the cafe's ethos, goals towards the public, history/past achievements and what customers can expect to find within the cafe itself. This information produces the end result of allowing new and returning customers to use said information to have any questions answered as well as interest customers into visiting the store itself.
## New User Goals
- User will be able to find all of the cafe's accessibiliity information resulting in them knowing where they are located as well as open hours.
- User can find any information about the cafe ethos, past achievements and history.
- User can make enquiries about specific questions or comments through the website, or business enquiries.
## Returning User Goals
- User will be able to revisit or remind themselves of all the cafe's accessibiliity information.
- User can revisit or remind themselves any information about the cafe ethos, past achievements or history.
- User can make enquiries about specific questions or comments through the website, or business enquiries.
