This Website is made on the behalf of "Hackney Coffee", a community made London based cafe. Users will find all the concise information they need in a simple yet UX orientated design. This project is intended for educational purposes only, and not intended for business/professional use. The project is built with HTML and CSS ONLY and incorporates bootstrap framework to keep the website clear and understable for first-time readers.

# UX Design/Development
## Website Owner Goals
The purpose of this website is to present the cafe's information to the public (new/returning customers). The website owner can present the accessibiliity information (cafe name, location, open hours, contact information for business and enquiries) as well as the cafe's ethos, goals towards the public, history/past achievements and what customers can expect to find within the cafe itself. This information produces the end result of allowing new and returning customers to use said information to have any questions answered as well as interest customers into visiting the store itself.
## New User Goals
- User will be able to find all of the cafe's accessibiliity information resulting in them knowing where they are located as well as open hours.
- User can find any information about the cafe ethos, past achievements and history.
- User can make enquiries about specific questions or comments through the website, or business enquiries.
## Returning User Goals
- User will be able to revisit or remind themselves of all the cafe's accessibiliity information.
- User can revisit or remind themselves any information about the cafe ethos, past achievements or history.
- User can make enquiries about specific questions or comments through the website, or business enquiries.

## Target Audience Wants and Needs

### As a business owner:
- I would like to present myself and my business appropriately showing clearly what my business has to offer for potential customers.
- I need to make sure that potential and returning customers are aware of the store's exact location and open times simply and clearly, so that they are able to locate the store properly and without any issues.
- I want potential customers to be interested by the website/the aesthetic of the website as well as understand clearly what it is intended for at first glance.
- I want potential customers to be able to easily learn to navigate the website with ease.
- I need to create and maintain a good relationship with potential, new and returning customers to create a positive result from a business and reputation standpoint.

### As a new/potential customer:
- I wish to find all the basic information about the business including their ethos, history/past achievements and qualifications.
- I wish to find out what menu items this cafe specialises in, and what other items they serve.
- I want to feel like the cafe advertised in this website is a place that I can fit in and share common interests and makes me want to visit.
- I want to find the contact information, location and open hours to this business with relative ease so I can visit, make enquiries and find when is best to visit.

### As a returning customer:
- I wish to be able to revisit all the information in case I need to remind myself of it.
- I wish to use this website as a way of showing others e.g. friends, family about this cafe.

## Website Structure

The website was create with simplicity and ease of access in mind, so that would result in a hassle free positive user experience. This result should not differ between devices as the page is made to be responsive to all common viewports to generate the same positive emotional response. All sections of each page are designed to allow for maximal user satisfaction. Examples of this include the theme or style created being targetted towards coffee, which is a common interest for the target audience, as well as the styling used for hover sections and links leading to the aforementioned positive user response.

## Wireframes

Simple and minimal mockups were created at the start with Balsamiq Wireframes, which I would then experiment with and playtest later in gitpod until I would find positioning and styling that I was happy with.

## Style testing

### Colours
As mentioned above I tested for the best colour combination to allow for readability.
These are the main colours I used:
- Main Background/inverted headers/text for contrast: #f5deb3 (Wheat)
- Main content text: #845c47 (Hazel/Coffee Brown)
- Headers: #644444 (Maroon/Dark Chocolate Brown)

### Fonts
The main font I used was Roboto, and Bebas Neue for the headers. I also used East Sea Dokdo for the menu lists, to give them more of a chalk on blackboard asethetic. I used Sans Serif as a backup font.

### Images
For images used, please refer to the [Assets Folder](https://github.com/Liam-WB/hackney-coffee/tree/main/assets/images).

# Features
This website consists of 4 pages, 3 of which are accessible via the navigation menu and 1 is a success page, accessible after sending a message in the contact form page.

The website contains the listed below features:

## Header and Navigation Bar

**The header is fully interactive with a logo and "icon" that when clicked on send you to the homepage. It also contains a nav bar on the right side, and each section that is hovered over is underlined giving a clear visual queue as to which page the user will be sent to when clicked on. The header is also fully responsive and when switching to tablet/phone sized viewports the menu switches to a compact menu.**
- The logo is placed on the left along with the coffee beans themed icon (which is hidden on smaller viewports for higher visibility).
- The nav bar, located on the right side is positioned depending on the viewport size and consists of 3 main sections: Home, Menu, Contact.

## Contact Section

- Consists of the email address, phone number and location of the cafe -All essential information for readers to know.
- Coloured appropriately depending on the page, as not all pages consist of the same background although they share the same theme.
- Contents are styled appropriately depending on viewport sizes.

## Footer

- Consists of the social media links, presented as icons for the user to click on.
- Positioned and sized appropriately and responsively, so that they aren't too distracting, but are easily accessible.
- Styled minimally to not take away form the main contents of the website, yet still keep to the theme.

## Home Page

- The Home Page is designed with a scroll-down presentation style, so that the content is narrowly placed on a 1 way path allowing users to easily find what they're looking for.
- The home page is essentially multiple pages of content stacked on top of eachother made for newer users to be able to scroll through the content step by step if they're exploring (whilst still being given the option of heading to whatver page they need via the nav bar)
- The background is a coffee table aesthetic made to go perfectly with the colour theme mentioned above, and large enough to fill the length of the page.
- The home page contains 4 unique sections (on top of the above mentioned sections which are commonly found on all pages):
  ### Main section
  - A welcome message/slogan -One of the first things the user will see, shows the location and instantly gives the user an idea of what the website is for.
  - Styled to be responsive to all viewports.
  ### About section
  - Contains the cafe ethos, history/origin and goals for the future.
  - Styled to fit different view ports
  ### Different section
  - Contains boxes of information giving the user facts about the cafe and feeding them selling points as well as nutritional information.
  - Styled to spread out on larger viewports, but is positioned in the above mentioned narrow presentation on smaller devices for visibility.
  ### Open Times Section
  - Contains the open hours and days in a concise and neat table.
  - Styled with contrast in mind to allow users to locate the information easily.
  ### Map section
  -Located just above the contact section, the map section is an embedded google maps iframe styled with a border (matching the contact section) made as an easily accessible and interactive section for users to easily locate the cafe, as well as keep users on the site, so that they're not distracted by opening another website.
  -Sized appropriately, depending on viewport size.

## Menu Page

- The menu page is a simple section consisting of all the aforementioned parts, and the menu section.
  ### Menu section
  - Contains the menu heading, followed by a hr that fits the content, but is styled to fit screen width on smaller viewports.
  - Contains 3 main menu sections spread across the screen and positioned in a more narrow presentation as the viewports get smaller. These consist of "chalkboard" backgrounds and "chalk" styled text to give off the idea of an actual cafe menu.

## Contact (form) Page

- The contact page also consists of all the aforementioned parts, as well as the form section itself.
  ### Form section
  - The form contains a h2 to declare the page like the one in the menu page.
  - It also contains an input section for the user's name, email and phone number that are required and will be taken down when a message is sent in the textarea input. Once a message is sent, the user is redirected to the success page.

## Success Page

-Contains the ordinary structure and size of the contact page, but the form is replaced with a "processing/confirmation" message.

## Future implmentations to explore

**The following ideas/parts were concepted or possible, but were not added due to time constraints, or practicality reasons.**

- Reviews page: An interactive page allowing for user feedback as well as a section to add more imagery content.
- Videos/Audio file: Was explored, but were found to be most effective if I added another page, which I would need more time for.
- Extra nav bar for the home page, or a sticky nav bar: For ease of access.

## Issues/bugs found during testing/development:
- Encountered an issue where certain icons were'nt appearing as intended.
- This was only on certain icons, where I would recieve error messages such as "ERROR GET favicon " so I kept away from icons that were giving these error messages as I assumed they were not formatted properly.

- Encountered an issue where certain elements were not scaling down properly according to their viewport sizes.
![Overflow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/126467141/235235799-c409c924-15ff-4941-894b-40c792ab4805.png)
- I fixed this by changing the CSS for a bunch of smaller elements. Some smaller elements such as the "main-text" elements were given fixed sizes and box models as I did not think it would be an issue at the time and had not yet thought about media queries. I then changed these types of elements' sizes to percentages so the content would adapt easier to different viewports.

- Encountered an issue where the form was not redirecting to the success page when it was linked.
- Initially I had intended to use the Code Institute form dump page, for the message submission confirmation, but decided it did not fit well and was not tailored to my website, so changed it to the success page. In doing so, I tried multiple ways of keeping both the form dump page as the form post location and the success page as the page the user is redirected to. I tried making the textarea an element outside of the form and giving it the "form" attribute as well as changing the submit input into a button with an anchor tag, but in the end the form dump page would always override the other "action" or "href", so for now I have removed the form dump page link and post method.
