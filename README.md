This Website is made on the behalf of "Hackney Coffee", a community made London based cafe. Users will find all the concise information they need in a simple yet UX orientated design. This project is intended for educational purposes only, and not intended for business/professional use. The project is built with HTML and CSS ONLY and incorporates bootstrap framework to keep the website clear and understable for first-time readers.
